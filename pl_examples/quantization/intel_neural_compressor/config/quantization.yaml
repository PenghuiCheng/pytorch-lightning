model:
  name: imagenet
  framework: pytorch_fx                              # supported values are pytorch, pytorch_fx, pytorch_ipex...and so on.

device: cpu

quantization:
  approach: post_training_static_quant               # supported values are post_training_static_quant, post_training_dynamic_quant, quant_aware_training.
  calibration:
    sampling_size: 300

tuning:
  accuracy_criterion:
    relative:  0.01                                  # optional. default value is relative, other value is absolute. this example allows relative accuracy loss: 1%.
  exit_policy:
    timeout: 0                                       # optional. tuning timeout (seconds). default value is 0 which means early stop. combine with max_trials field to decide when to exit.
    max_trials: 1200
  random_seed: 9527                                  # optional. random seed for deterministic tuning.
